# Diamond-prices-ML-Kaggle-competition

The goal of the project is to obtain the best prediction of the price of the diamonds according to some features.

## Description:

The `main.py` file will take the train and test data set, clean it according to some data exploration process in the notebook `Data_exploration.ipynb`, and it will run the best model chosen from a model selection process described in the notebook `Model_selection.ipynb`. 

The output of this process is a csv file in the `OUTPUT` folder called `submission.csv` that can be uploaded to the competition website in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/diamonds-datamad0320/leaderboard#score

Bonus: Extra notebook with the modelling done in h2o
